# Protocol Buffers for the Rest of Us

## Motivation

`protoletariat` has one goal: fixing the broken imports for the Python code
generated by `protoc`.

## Usage

Here's an example of how to use the tool, called `protol`:

1. Create a few protobuf files

```protobuf
// thing1.proto
syntax = "proto3";

import "thing2.proto";

package things;

message Thing1 {
  Thing2 thing2 = 1;
}
```

```protobuf
// thing2.proto
syntax = "proto3";

package things;

message Thing2 {
  string data = 1;
}
```

2. Run `protoc` on those files

```sh
$ mkdir out
$ protoc --python_out=out --proto_path=directory/containing/protos thing1.proto thing2.proto
```

3. Run `protol` on the generated code

```sh
$ protol --create-init --overwrite -g out protoc --proto-path=directory/containing/protos thing1.proto thing2.proto
```

The `out/thing1_pb2.py` file should show a diff containing at least these lines:

```patch
-import thing2_pb2 as thing2__pb2
-
+from . import thing2_pb2 as thing2__pb2
```

## How it works

At a high level, `protoletariat` converts absolute imports to relative imports.

However, it doesn't just convert any absolute import to a relative import.

The `protol` tool will only convert imports that were generated from `.proto` files. It
does this by inspecting `FileDescriptorProtos` from the protobuf files.

The core mechanism is implemented using a simplified form of pattern matching,
that looks at the Python AST, and if an import pattern is matched and
corresponding rewrite rule is fired.

## Help

```
$ protol
Usage: protol [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  Rewrite protoc or buf-generated imports for use by the protoletariat.

Options:
  -g, --generated-python-dir DIRECTORY
                                  Directory containing generated Python code
                                  [required]
  --overwrite / --no-overwrite    Overwrite all relevant files under
                                  `generated_python_dir`  [default: no-overwrite]
  --create-init / --dont-create-init
                                  Create an empty __init__.py file under
                                  `generated_python_dir`  [default: dont-create-init]
  --help                          Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  buf     Use buf to generate the FileDescriptorSet blob
  protoc  Use protoc to generate the FileDescriptorSet blob
```
